Notely
Notely is an application that allows users to manage their personal notes and ideas. The goal here is to build a user-friendly application with smooth interactions that mimic the feel of real world note taking apps.

Before you start:

In the project description, the term and note and entry are being used interchangeably, they mean one and the same thing, where a note, (also referred to as an entry) is a written record created to capture ideas, thoughts, or any information they want to save. The plural is notes or entries (which also mean the same thing)
Key Features
User Authentication
Users sign up with the following details
first name - required
last name - required
username - required
email address - required
password - required
Upon successful sign up, the user should be redirected to the login page where they can login to their account using email or username together with their password.
After a successful login, the user should be redirected to their dashboard. The default view should display a list of all their existing notes. If the user doesn’t have any notes yet, show a friendly message such as: "You don’t have any notes yet."
Notes System
Users can create notes with the following details:
Title (required): A short descriptive heading provided by the user.
Synopsis (required): A brief summary of the entry's content provided by the user.
Content (required): The full body of the entry, written by the user. The content should be in markdown.
Date Created: Automatically generated by the application when the note is created.
Last Updated: Timestamp that reflects the last time the note was modified.
isDeleted: A boolean indicating whether the note is deleted. The default value is false. When set to true, the entry should not appear in the default list of notes in the frontend but should remain in the database for possible restoration or permanent deletion later.
Make sure to implement a nice clean interface for creating an entry.
On the notes listing page, display all user notes in a clean, visually appealing card layout. Each card should clearly present key information and provide quick actions. At a minimum, each card must include:
Title of the entry
Synopsis
A "Read More" button that navigates to a dedicated page with the full note
An option to edit the note
An option to delete the note
In displaying an entry, the markdown content should be displayed as HTML, you can use markdown to HTML tools on npm (markdown to HTML tools).
If an entry has been deleted, don't display it, show a 'not found' message instead.
Establish a one-to-many relationship between the users and entries tables/models, one user can have multiple entries, but each entry should belong to a single user.
When the user clicks the Edit option on an entry, they should be redirected to a dedicated "Edit Entry page". This page should display a form that is pre-populated with the entry's existing Title, Synopsis, and Content. The user can then modify any of these fields and submit the form to update the entry. Upon successful update, they should receive feedback (e.g., a success message) and be redirected appropriately, either back to the notes listing or the updated entry's detail page.
When a user chooses to delete an entry, the entry should be removed from the visible list immediately to reflect that it has been deleted. This deletion should be handled via soft delete (using the isDeleted flag), meaning the note is not permanently removed from the database but simply excluded from standard views. After deletion, the user should remain on the current page and see the updated list of remaining notes, providing immediate visual confirmation that the selected entry is no longer present.
Provide a dedicated Trash page where users can view all of their deleted entries. Only notes marked as deleted (isDeleted = true) should appear here, allowing users to review, restore, or permanently delete them. If the users don't have any deleted notes, show them a friendly message like "nothing to show here".
From the Trash page, users should have the option to restore any deleted entry. Restoring an entry should simply involve resetting its isDeleted flag to false, making it visible again in the main entries listing. Once restored, the entry should disappear from the Trash and reappear in its original position among the user’s active notes.
Display an informational message on the Trash page, such as: "Items in trash will be permanently deleted after 30 days." (Implementing the feature itself for deleting items in the trash after 30 days is optional though)
Users Profile
This page should include the following:
form pre-filled with their personal details (first name, last name, username, email), users can use this form to update their details - implement functionality for users to update their primary information (first name, last name, username, email).
Users should have the ability to upload a profile picture. This feature must be implemented. Once a user updates their profile picture, it should be immediately displayed in the top-right corner of the interface. If the user has not uploaded a profile picture, display their initials instead as a fallback avatar.
A form to update the password:
The form should contain input fields for current, new password and confirm new password.
If a user wants to update their password, they must enter both the current and the new password, if they enter wrong current password, show them an error and don't update the password.
Always hash passwords, even the updated password should be hashed.
A logout button with the functionality working.

API
You're encouraged to add any extra API endpoints you think are necessary to support missing or critical features.

POST /api/auth/register: register a user

POST /api/auth/login: login a user.

POST /api/auth/logout: logout a user.

POST /api/auth/password: update a specific user's password.

DELETE /api/entry/:id: mark a specific entry as deleted.

PATCH /api/user/ update user's primary information (and the avatar url as well).

NOTE: for the user's avatar, you should upload the image to cloudinary (recommended) or any similar service and store the generated URL in the database.

Models
This application will only have the following two models:

User
id - primary key (use uuid)
first name - required
last name - required
email - unique and required
username - unique and required
password - required
avatar - url for user's avatar, not required and the default is null or, empty string or any falsy value.
dateJoined - date
last profile update - date
isDeleted - boolean with a default of false
Entry
id - primary key (use uuid)
title - string
synopsis - string
content - string
isDeleted - boolean indicating whether the entry has been deleted, the default value is false.
date created
last updated
Remember to implement one-to-many relationship between the two (one user can have multiple entries).
NOTE: YOU ARE WELCOMED TO IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN ADDITIONAL FEATURES BUT THE FEATURES LISTED ABOVE ARE COMPULSORY

Bonus features
If you're feeling super-fancy and motivated, consider implementing the following features:

Private/Public toggle for Entries:
Add an isPublic boolean field to each entry. By default, entries should be private (false). Setting it to true marks the entry as public and potentially viewable by others.
Save/Bookmark Entries:
Let users "save" entries they like or want to revisit later, this can apply to their own notes or public notes from other users, depending on your implementation.
Pinned Entries:
Allow users to pin important notes so they always appear at the top of their notes list. Probably, you might need a new model for this.
